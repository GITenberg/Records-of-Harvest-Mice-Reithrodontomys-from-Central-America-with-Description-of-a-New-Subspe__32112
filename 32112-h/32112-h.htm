<p>Since 1952 when Hooper's review of Latin American harvest mice
was published, collectors from the Museum of Natural History of
the University of Kansas have visited several countries in Central
America, and have obtained many additional specimens. Among
these we find a new subspecies of <i>Reithrodontomys fulvescens</i> from
Nicaragua, significant extensions of known geographic range for
several other species, and additional information on variation in
some little known kinds. Specimens in the Museum of Natural
History of <i>Reithrodontomys mexicanus cherriei</i>, <i>Reithrodontomys
tenuirostris</i>, and <i>Reithrodontomys creper</i> that are from within the
geographic and altitudinal ranges listed by Hooper (1952) are not
included in this report.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>All place names are on the map of Hispanic America published by the
American Geographical Society and can be located by consulting the "Index
to map of Hispanic America" (Vol. 1, Geographical names in Central America,
U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C., 1943.) All measurements
cited are in millimeters.</p>

<p>Support for field work was provided by the Kansas University Endowment
Association. Support for the laboratory phases of the work came in part from
a grant from the National Science Foundation. Most of the specimens herein
reported were collected by James W. Bee in late 1954 and early 1955, and by
J. R. Alcorn and A. A. Alcorn in 1955 and 1956. A few that were collected
earlier by other persons are mentioned. We are indebted to the following
individuals for the loan of specimens in their care: R. G. Van Gelder, American
Museum of Natural History; Philip Hershkovitz, Chicago Natural History Museum;
W. H. Burt and E. T. Hooper, Museum of Zoology, University of
Michigan; and D. H. Johnson and C. O. Handley, Jr., U. S. National Museum.</p></div>

<p><b><i>Reithrodontomys sumichrasti australis</i></b> J. A. Allen.&mdash;Seven specimens
from the vicinity of Volcan Iraz&uacute;, Cartago, Costa Rica, are
from within the geographic and altitudinal range recorded for the
subspecies by Hooper (1952:82).</p>

<p>One female, KU 26967, trapped on March 2, 1947, on the SW
slope of Volcan Iraz&uacute;, 8500 ft., contained five embryos that were
17 mm. in crown-rump length.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span></p>

<p><b><i>Reithrodontomys sumichrasti dorsalis</i></b> Merriam.&mdash;A total of 93
females are among 195 specimens from 24 localities in Guatemala
that lie within the geographic and altitudinal range recorded by
Hooper (1952:78) for <i>dorsalis</i>.</p>

<p>Two females were pregnant; KU 71363, taken on January 28, 1956,
7 mi. E, 2 mi. S La Uni&oacute;n, Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, contained
three embryos that were 7 mm. in crown-rump length, and KU
65245, taken on December 15, 1954, 1 mi. NE Nebaj, 6000 ft.,
El Quiche, Guatemala, contained four embryos that were 15 mm.
in crown-rump length. These two females were the only pregnant
ones among 36 taken in December, 23 in January, 1 in February,
19 in March, 5 in April, and 9 in August.</p>

<p><b><i>Reithrodontomys fulvescens chiapensis</i></b> Howell.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Guatemala.</span>&mdash;Baja
Verapaz: 1/2 mi. N, 1 mi. E Salam&aacute;, 3200 ft., 1 (KU 65378&mdash;January
28, 1955); 1 mi. S Rabinal, 3450 ft., 4 (KU 65379-82&mdash;January
29, 1955); 5 mi. N, 1 mi. W [Santa Cruz] El Chol, 6000 ft.,
1 (KU 65375&mdash;January 30, 1955). Guatemala: 5 mi. S Guatemala
City, 4950 ft., 2 (KU 65371-72&mdash;March 13, 1955); 7 mi. S, 6 mi. E
Guatemala City, 5800 ft., 1 (KU 65370&mdash;March 14, 1955). Santa
Rosa: 2 mi. N, 2 mi. W Cuilapa [= Cuajiniquilapa], 2980 ft, 2
(KU 65376-77&mdash;March 5, 1955).</p>

<p>The specimens from the departments of Guatemala and Santa
Rosa are from localities that lie on the Pacific slope and are southwest
of the previously known range of the species (see Hooper,
1952:93). The specimens from 1/2 mi. N and 1 mi. E Salam&aacute; and
from 1 mi. S Rabinal are paler dorsally than other Guatemalan
specimens available to us, including the specimen from the nearby
locality, 5 mi. N and 1 mi. W El Chol.</p>

<p>Specimens from Nicaragua that are recognizable by the E-shaped
pattern of the worn occlusal surface of the third upper molars and
by the S-shaped occlusal pattern of the third lower molars as of
the species <i>Reithrodontomys fulvescens</i>, extend the known range
of the species approximately 200 kilometers southeast from the
vicinity of Tegucigalpa, Honduras (Hooper, 1952:93). The Nicaraguan
specimens are described below as a new subspecies.</p>


<p><b>Reithrodontomys fulvescens meridionalis</b>, new subspecies</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Type specimen.</i>&mdash;Skin and skull of adult male, no. 71388 Museum of Natural
History, University of Kansas, from 9 mi. NNW Estel&iacute;, Estel&iacute;, Nicaragua; obtained
by J. R. Alcorn on July 15, 1956; original number 21,464.</p>

<p><i>Diagnostic characters.</i>&mdash;A short-tailed <i>Reithrodontomys fulvescens</i> having
a distinctly streaked or "peppered," and short pelage composed of relatively
dark hairs as well as relatively brightly colored hairs on dorsum and white-tipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
hairs on venter; and having shallow skull, elongate and posteriorly
attenuate incisive foramina, small postpalatal foramina, broad interorbital region,
and mid-dorsal depression at junction of nasal and frontal bones.</p></div>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;Each of three adults of <i>meridionalis</i> (trapped in
February and March) can be distinguished from seven adults of
the geographically adjacent <i>R. f. chiapensis</i> from Guatemala
(trapped in late January and in March) by shorter tail, more
streaked or "peppered" dorsal pelage, yellower hue of non-blackish
parts of hairs on dorsum, less distinct mid-dorsal darkening, and
more whitish (less buffy) venter.</p>

<p>Four specimens of <i>meridionalis</i> trapped in July at the type locality,
only one mile from the locality of capture of the February-taken
specimens, are distinctly darker dorsally and slightly darker
ventrally than the three <i>meridionalis</i> trapped in February and
March, but resemble the latter three in shortness of tail and in
having short, "peppered" dorsal pelage. We lack specimens of
<i>chiapensis</i> in summer pelage. According to Hooper (1952:122)
the summer pelages of <i>R. f. chiapensis</i> and <i>R. f. helvolus</i> are indistinguishable.
Our <i>meridionalis</i> differ from five summer-taken specimens
of <i>helvolus</i> in shorter, more "peppered," and distinctly darker
dorsal pelage.</p>

<p>Six skulls of <i>meridionalis</i> were matched with six skulls of <i>chiapensis</i>
having approximately the same amount of wear on the teeth,
and the series were compared, pair by pair, in various cranial
characters. In five of the six pairs <i>meridionalis</i> had a less inflated
braincase, and smaller postpalatal foramina, and in each of the six
pairs <i>meridionalis</i> had a greater depression in the frontonasal region
and posteriorly more acute incisive foramina. Four external measurements
and nine cranial measurements were compared using the
series of <i>meridionalis</i>, the series of <i>chiapensis</i> from Guatemala, and
Hooper's (1952:213) measurements of seven <i>chiapensis</i> from central
Chiapas. The lesser average and maximum total length of
skull in <i>meridionalis</i> than in either series of <i>chiapensis</i> suggests that
<i>meridionalis</i> has a smaller skull. Externally, the lesser total length
of <i>meridionalis</i> is largely owing to its shorter tail; there is little
difference in length of head and body between <i>meridionalis</i> and
<i>chiapensis</i>. The longest tail among our <i>meridionalis</i> is shorter than
the shortest tail among the <i>chiapensis</i> (disregarding two Guatemalan
specimens of <i>chiapensis</i> that probably had injured tails). The
interorbital breadth of <i>meridionalis</i> is on the average greater and
the depth of cranium is less than in <i>chiapensis</i>. There is some overlap
in the range of each of these two cranial measurements, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
all <i>meridionalis</i> the interorbital breadth exceeds 42 per cent of the
depth of cranium, and in all <i>chiapensis</i> is less than 42 per cent.
The length of the incisive foramina in <i>meridionalis</i>, expressed as a
percentage of the total length of the skull, is usually greater than
in <i>chiapensis</i>.</p>

<p>One of our specimens (KU 71389) contained four embryos that
measured 5 mm. in crown-rump length.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;Selected measurements of the holotype, followed by the
average and extreme measurements of six specimens of <i>meridionalis</i> (including
the holotype) from the vicinity of the type locality are: total length, 154, 152.0
(148-154); length of tail, 82, 82.0 (81-83); length of hind foot, 17, 18.0
(17-19); length of ear from notch, 13, 13.3 (12-14); total length of skull,
21.4, 21.13 (20.3-21.7); zygomatic breadth, 10.0, 10.38 (10.0-10.6); breadth
of braincase, 10.1, 10.17 (9.9-10.4); depth of skull, 8.2, 8.00 (7.8-8.3); interorbital
constriction, 3.7, 3.53 (3.4-3.7); breadth of rostrum, 3.8, 3.75 (3.6-3.9);
length of rostrum, 7.4, 7.33 (7.1-7.7); length of incisive foramen, 4.6, 4.47
(4.2-4.6); length of upper molar tooth-row, 3.2, 3.32 (3.2-3.5). Corresponding
measurements of a specimen from 11 mi. SE Dar&iacute;o are: 153, 82, 18, 13,
20.7, 10.3, 10.1, 7.8, 3.4, 3.6, 7.2, 4.3, and 3.2.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined, 8, as follows</i>: <span class="smcap">Nicaragua</span>.&mdash;Estel&iacute;: 9 mi. NNW
Estel&iacute;, 4 (KU 71386-89&mdash;July 15, 1956); 8 mi. NNW Estel&iacute;, 3 (KU 71393-95&mdash;February
5, 1956). Matagalpa: 11 mi. SE Dar&iacute;o, 1 (KU 71392&mdash;March 21,
1956).</p>

<p>Specimens of <i>Reithrodontomys fulvescens helvolus</i> used in comparisons:
<span class="smcap">Oaxaca</span>: 3 mi. ESE Oaxaca, 1 (KU 68891&mdash;June 24, 1955); 3 mi. W Mitla,
4 (KU 68892-95&mdash;August 5 to 9, 1955).</p></div>

<p><b><i>Reithrodontomys gracilis anthonyi</i></b> Goodwin.&mdash;<span class="smcap">El Salvador</span>.&mdash;Santa
Ana: 2 mi. SE San Crist&oacute;bal, 2950 ft., 2 (KU 65401-02&mdash;March
6, 1955). <span class="smcap">Guatemala</span>.&mdash;Jutiapa: 2-1/2 mi. W, 2-1/4 mi. N San
Crist&oacute;bal [El Salvador], 2900 ft., 5 (KU 65396-400&mdash;March 6, 1955).</p>

<p>The subspecies <i>anthonyi</i> has been known previously by seven
specimens, none of which is fully adult, judging from Hooper's
(1952:134) comment that the adult pelage of <i>anthonyi</i> is unknown.
Six of our seven specimens are clearly adults as is shown by well-worn
teeth and degree of development of temporal ridges. The
seventh is a young animal in process of postjuvenal molt. Individuals
from our series in general resemble specimens of <i>Reithrodontomys
mexicanus orinus</i> from the vicinity of Guatemala City
but differ from the latter as follows: dorsal pelage brighter (with
less suffusion of black), "peppered" in appearance, shorter and
sparser; ears distinctly paler, owing both to the paler color of the
skin and the paleness of the hairs inside the pinna; dark tarsal stripe
not extending onto hind foot; ears and hind feet uniformly smaller;
averaging smaller in cranial dimensions (but there is considerable
overlap), braincase less convex dorsally.</p>

<p>Measurements of the adult <i>anthonyi</i> now available show that the
subspecies reaches a greater size than was apparent in the sample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
available to Hooper. Consequently the three largest adults would
be identified as <i>R. mexicanus</i> according to Hooper's key (1952:31),
rather than <i>R. gracilis</i>, and the three smallest adults could not be
unequivocably identified as either one species or the other.</p>

<p>The ranges of <i>R. gracilis</i> and <i>R. mexicanus</i> are allopatric except
in southern Guatemala where the ranges overlap. However, the
two species have not been taken there at the same place.</p>

<p>In comparison with May-taken adults of <i>R. g. harrisi</i> from 3 mi.
SW Managua, Nicaragua, the adult <i>anthonyi</i> average brighter (more
orange) in color (but two of the <i>anthonyi</i> cannot be distinguished
by color when placed with the <i>harrisi</i>), and are larger in total length,
length of tail, and size of skull.</p>

<p>One female (KU 65400) contained two embryos that measured
18 mm. in crown-rump length.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Average and extreme external and cranial measurements of the six adults
are: total length, 183.6 (170-198); length of tail, 106.0 (95-113); length of
hind foot, 18.0 (18); length of ear from notch, 14.0 (14); total length of skull,
22.21 (21.4-22.8); zygomatic breadth, 11.20 (10.9-11.7); breadth of braincase,
10.90 (10.3-11.4); depth of skull, 8.36 (8.0-9.0); length of rostrum, 7.60
(7.3-7.8); breadth of rostrum, 4.24 (4.0-4.6); interorbital constriction, 3.78
(3.6-4.0); length of incisive foramen, 4.05 (3.8-4.3); length of upper molar
tooth-row, 3.28 (3.1-3.4). Weight in grams of the adults averaged 14.3
(12-17).</p></div>

<p><b><i>Reithrodontomys gracilis gracilis</i></b> Allen and Chapman.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Guatemala</span>.&mdash;El
Pet&eacute;n: Uaxact&uacute;n, 1500 ft., 2 (KU 65384-85&mdash;April 3,
1955).</p>

<p>These specimens are the first of the subspecies to be recorded
from Guatemala. Uaxact&uacute;n is near, but not within, the range of
<i>R. g. gracilis</i> as mapped by Hooper (1952:131). The male, KU
65384, and female, KU 65385, are adults with comparatively unworn
molar teeth. Respective external measurements are: total length,
178, 175; length of tail, 106, 102; length of hind foot, 18.5, 19; length
of ear from notch, 14, 14.</p>

<p><b><i>Reithrodontomys gracilis harrisi</i></b> Goodwin.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nicaragua</span>.&mdash;Estel&iacute;:
9 mi. NNW Estel&iacute;, 1 (KU 71342&mdash;July 15, 1956). Managua:
3 mi. SW Managua, 15 (KU 71345-59&mdash;February, May, June, 1956);
4 mi. W Managua, 2 (KU 71360-61&mdash;June 26, 28, 1956).</p>

<p>Comments on the series from 3 mi. SW Managua have appeared
elsewhere (Englert, 1959:153). The specimen from 9 mi. NNW
Estel&iacute; contained four embryos that measured 5 mm. in crown-rump
length.</p>

<p><b><i>Reithrodontomys gracilis pacificus</i></b> Goodwin.&mdash;<span class="smcap">El Salvador</span>.&mdash;San
Salvador: 1 mi. NW San Salvador, 1 (KU 71396&mdash;July 29,
1956).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span></p>

<p>In coloration (being but slightly paler), and in small size, this
specimen resembles the description of <i>R. g. pacificus</i> given by
Hooper (1952:135) and ten specimens of <i>pacificus</i> (nine from
Guatemala and one from Chiapas) examined by us. Because of
this resemblance and the marked contrast with specimens of <i>R. g.
anthonyi</i> discussed above we assign this specimen to <i>pacificus</i>. In
comparison with two topotypes (AMNH 79062, 79090) of <i>R. g.
anthonyi</i> from Sacapulas, Guatemala, taken on February 9 and
March 2 that are essentially the same age as KU 71396, the latter
specimen is darker dorsally, the tail is darker both dorsally and
ventrally, and the skull is smaller. In paleness of upper surface
of hind feet, length of palate relative to length of incisive foramina,
and size of bullae, KU 71396 resembles <i>anthonyi</i>. We interpret
these resemblances to <i>anthonyi</i> as evidence of intergradation between
<i>pacificus</i> and <i>anthonyi</i>. Felten (1958:9) referred two specimens
from El Salvador (one from San Salvador and one from
Amate de Campo, Departmento de La Paz) to <i>anthonyi</i>, without
comparison with <i>pacificus</i> and with no mention of examination of
other specimens of <i>Reithrodontomys gracilis</i>. When the distribution
and variation of <i>R. gracilis</i> in this region are more adequately
known these two specimens may well be reassigned to <i>pacificus</i>.
Hooper (1952:134) observed that two specimens from Monte Cristo
Mine in eastern El Salvador were the smallest and darkest of the
<i>R. g. anthonyi</i> examined by him and approached <i>R. g. pacificus</i> in
these particulars. Possibly these specimens from Monte Cristo
Mine also should be assigned to <i>pacificus</i> rather than <i>anthonyi</i>.
External measurements of KU 71396 are: total length, 167; length
of tail, 99; length of hind foot, 19; length of ear from notch, 13. The
specimen contained four embryos that measured 10 mm. in crown-rump
length.</p>

<p><b><i>Reithrodontomys microdon microdon</i></b> Merriam.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Guatemala</span>.&mdash;Huehuetenango:
2 mi. S San Juan Ixcoy, 9340 ft., 10 (KU 65404-13&mdash;December
24 and 25, 1954); 3-1/2 mi. SW San Juan Ixcoy, 10,120 ft.,
4 (KU 65210, 65414-15, 65417&mdash;December 27 and 28, 1954). San
Marcos: 3-1/4 mi. N, 3/4 mi. E San Marcos, 9500 ft, 1 (KU 65420&mdash;March
22, 1955). Totonicap&aacute;n: 5 mi. ESE Totonicap&aacute;n, 4 (KU
68897-900&mdash;July 17, 1955).</p>

<p>All the localities from which we have examined specimens fall
within the geographic range of the subspecies as mapped by Hooper
(1952:168). He examined six specimens of <i>R. m. microdon</i> and
listed external and cranial measurements for only two specimens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Average and extreme external measurements of 13 adults (7 males, 6
females) from the vicinity of San Juan Ixcoy are: total length, 176.5 (168-187);
length of tail, 105.8 (100-110); length of hind foot, 19.5 (19-20);
length of ear from notch, 16.8 (15-18). The average weight in grams of these
same specimens is 9.1 (8-11). Average and extreme cranial measurements
of 12 specimens from the same series (7 males, 5 females) are: total length
of skull, 22.55 (21.6-23.0); zygomatic breadth, 10.82 (10.2-11.2); breadth of
braincase, 11.02 (10.6-11.4); depth of skull, 8.67 (8.4-8.9); interorbital constriction,
3.78 (3.6-3.9); breadth of rostrum, 3.86 (3.6-4.0); length of rostrum,
8.33 (8.1-8.6); length of incisive foramen, 4.27 (4.0-4.5); length of palate,
3.48 (3.2-3.8); length of upper molar tooth-row, 3.25 (3.0-3.4).</p></div>

<p><b><i>Reithrodontomys mexicanus howelli</i></b> Goodwin.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Guatemala</span>.&mdash;Baja
Verapaz: 5 mi. N, 1 mi. W [Santa Cruz] El Chol, 6000 ft., 3
(KU 65315, 65386-87&mdash;January 30, 1955). El Quiche: 1 mi. NE
Nebaj, 6000 ft., 2 (KU 65275, 65277&mdash;December 19, 1954). Huehuetenango:
5 mi. E, 1 mi. N Huehuetenango, 7000 ft., 2 (KU
65418-19&mdash;December 22, 1954). Santa Rosa: 1 mi. WSW El Molino
[= approximately 1 mi. S, 6 mi. E Cuajiniquilapa], 1 (KU 71315&mdash;August
3, 1956).</p>

<p>The specimen from 1 mi. WSW El Molino is from within the
range of the subspecies <i>R. m. orinus</i> as mapped by Hooper (1952:141),
coming from a locality to the southeast of the two westernmost
localities shown by him for <i>orinus</i>. This mouse is distinctly darker
than any of the specimens of <i>orinus</i> discussed beyond, and is as dark
as the darkest <i>howelli</i> seen by us. In addition to the specimens of
<i>howelli</i> listed above, we have examined 12 from Prusia, Chiapas
(UMMZ 88351-58, 96810-13), and three from 3 mi. NW San Crist&oacute;bal,
Chiapas (KU 66680-82).</p>

<p><i>R. m. howelli</i> may occur at moderate elevations along the coast of
southern Guatemala, or possibly this specimen represents a population
of dark-colored mice that is isolated from similarly colored
populations to the north and west. According to the field notes of
Albert A. Alcorn, the collector, this specimen was taken in a "tree
set." Perhaps pale-colored and dark-colored populations of <i>R. mexicanus</i>
are sympatric but ecologically segregated in this region.</p>

<p><b><i>Reithrodontomys mexicanus lucifrons</i></b> Howell.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nicaragua</span>.&mdash;Jinotega:
1 mi. NW Jinotega, 1 (KU 71344&mdash;April 12, 1956); 5 mi.
S, 2 mi. E Jinotega, 1 (KU 71343&mdash;April 12, 1956).</p>

<p>Comments on these specimens have appeared earlier (Englert,
1959:153).</p>

<p><b><i>Reithrodontomys mexicanus orinus</i></b> Hooper.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Guatemala</span>.&mdash;Guatemala:
5 mi. S Guatemala City, 4950 ft., 2 (KU 65388-89&mdash;March
11, 1955); 6 mi. S Guatemala City, 4680 ft., 3 (KU 65390-92&mdash;March<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
10, 1955); 7 mi. S, 6 mi. E Guatemala City, 5800 ft., 2 (KU
65393-94&mdash;March 14, 1955).</p>

<p>Our seven specimens are from near the northwestern edge of the
geographic range of <i>orinus</i> (where it meets that of <i>howelli</i>) as
mapped by Hooper (1952:141). Nevertheless, they are distinctly
brighter dorsally, paler ventrally, and average larger than the specimens
listed in the account of <i>R. m. howelli</i> above. Also, they match
well in size and coloration the specimens from nearby Lago de
Amatitlan (USNM 275406-09) and Finca San Rafael (CNHM
41770) that were referred by Hooper to <i>R. m. orinus</i>. He (<i>op. cit.</i>:149)
noted that these last-mentioned specimens were slightly darker
than topotypes of <i>orinus</i> and differed from them in several minor
cranial features, which he interpreted as evidence of intergradation
with <i>howelli</i>.</p>

<p><b><i>Reithrodontomys brevirostris</i></b> Goodwin.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Costa Rica</span>.&mdash;Alajuela:
5 mi. SW San Ram&oacute;n, 1 (KU 71362&mdash;July 11, 1956). <span class="smcap">Nicaragua</span>.&mdash;Carazo:
3 mi. NNW Diriamba, 2 (KU 71390-91&mdash;June 16, 21, 1956).</p>

<p>External measurements of these three specimens are respectively:
total length, 179, 167, 173; length of tail, 107, 96, 101; length of hind
foot, 19, 18, 18; length of ear from notch, 15, 13, 13. The teeth
show about the same moderate wear in each of the three specimens.
Our <i>brevirostris</i> differ noticeably from specimens of <i>Reithrodontomys
mexicanus cherriei</i> and <i>R. m. lucifrons</i> that we have seen in
duller, darker, and less reddish color. One specimen, KU 71390,
still has a patch of gray juvenal pelage on the nape; the newer pelage
elsewhere is shorter and sparser than that of the other two specimens.
In addition, No. 71390, a female, contained no embryos,
but has two pairs of mammae, one pair pectoral and one inguinal,
that are conspicuous on the dried skin; perhaps this female was
lactating when captured. The mammae of KU 71362, also a non-pregnant
female, are inconspicuous on the dried skin. The Nicaraguan
specimens extend the known geographic range approximately
270 kilometers northwestward from near Villa Quesada, Alajuela,
Costa Rica, and are the first records of the species from Nicaragua.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
